# 👋 Hi, I'm Soumyajyoti Chatterjee
### Machine Learning & Data Science Practitioner

I am a Machine Learning and Data Science practitioner with hands-on experience in building **production-ready ML systems**, analyzing real-world datasets, and applying statistical and machine learning techniques to solve practical problems.

My interests lie in **predictive analytics**, **model deployment**, and **data-driven decision making**, and I enjoy working across the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to production monitoring.

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 💳 Credit Risk ML System
🔗 https://github.com/SOUMYAJYOTI1234/credit_risk_ml_system

A **production-ready, end-to-end machine learning system** for predicting credit card default risk using the UCI Credit Card Default dataset (30,000 records).

**Highlights:**
- Trained and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost — best model selected by cross-validated ROC-AUC
- Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning and SHAP explainability (global + local)
- **FastAPI REST API** serving calibrated default probabilities with Swagger UI
- **Docker** containerisation for deployment
- **Data drift monitoring** using KS-test and Population Stability Index (PSI) with automated retraining alerts
- Full **CI/CD pipeline** via GitHub Actions (linting + pytest)
